# Degen Score Engine Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document tracks improvements to the Degen Score Engine based on comprehensive review of DeFi and casino platform detection capabilities.

## Current Implementation Gaps

### 1. Casino Platform Detection
- **Current**: Only checks token holdings (RLB, SHFL, YEET)
- **Issue**: Misses users who deposited but don't currently hold tokens
- **Impact**: Users who actively gambled but withdrew tokens get `casinos_used = 0`

### 2. DeFi Protocol Coverage
- **Current**: Limited to DEX routers (Uniswap, Sushi) and GMX
- **Missing**: Aave, Compound, yield aggregators, bridges
- **Impact**: Incomplete DeFi engagement scoring (15% weight)

### 3. Historical Data Limitations
- **Current**: Only recent blocks (30k-50k) due to RPC limits
- **Issue**: Misses older activity
- **Impact**: Long-term users may be underscored

## Detailed Implementation

### Casino Platform Interaction Detection

```rust
// New structure for tracking casino interactions
pub struct CasinoInteraction {
    platform: String,
    interaction_type: InteractionType,
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    value: Option<Decimal>,
}

pub enum InteractionType {
    Deposit,
    Withdrawal,
    Bet,
    Stake,
    TokenTransfer,
}
```

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Event Monitoring**: Check for specific events from casino contracts
   - Rollbit: Monitor Lottery participation events
   - Shuffle: Track router interactions
   - YEET: Detect token transfers and contract calls

2. **Direct Transaction Detection**: Scan for ETH/token transfers TO casino addresses
   - Flag any transaction to known casino contracts
   - Store interaction type and timestamp

3. **Platform Enumeration**: Maintain distinct set of used platforms
   - Not just token count but actual platform interaction count
   - Weight by recency and volume

### DeFi Protocol Expansion

#### Aave Integration:
```rust
// Aave V2 LendingPool events to monitor
const AAVE_DEPOSIT_EVENT: &str = "Deposit(address,address,address,uint256,address,uint16)";
const AAVE_BORROW_EVENT: &str = "Borrow(address,address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint16)";

// Check for user as depositor or borrower
async fn check_aave_activity(user: &Address) -> Result<AaveMetrics> {
    // Query Deposit events where user is the onBehalfOf address
    // Query Borrow events where user is the borrower
    // Return interaction count and volume
}
```

#### Compound Integration:
```rust
// Check cToken balances as proxy for Compound usage
const COMPOUND_CTOKENS: &[(&str, &str)] = &[
    ("0x5d3a536E4D6DbD6114cc1Ead35777bAB948E3643", "cDAI"),
    ("0x39AA39c021dfbaE8faC545936693aC917d5E7563", "cUSDC"),
    ("0x4Ddc2D193948926D02f9B1fE9e1daa0718270ED5", "cETH"),
];

async fn check_compound_activity(user: &Address) -> Result<CompoundMetrics> {
    // Check balances of all cTokens
    // Check Mint/Redeem events from cToken contracts
    // Return usage metrics
}
```

### Bridge and Cross-Chain Detection

```rust
// Hyperliquid bridge on Arbitrum
const HYPERLIQUID_BRIDGE: &str = "0x2Df1c51E09aECF9cacB7bc98cB1742757f163dF7";

// Other bridges to track
const BRIDGE_CONTRACTS: &[(&str, &str, &str)] = &[
    ("0x3666f603Cc164936C1b87e207F36BEBa4AC5f18a", "Hop", "ethereum"),
    ("0x4D71d4bC0bF6d6b30a4D29E70d6D0B918E8F5c36", "Across", "ethereum"),
    // Add more bridges
];
```

### Memecoin Detection Enhancement

```rust
// Expanded memecoin list with contract addresses
pub fn extended_memecoin_list() -> HashMap<&'static str, &'static str> {
    [
        ("0x6982508145454Ce325dDbE47a25d4ec3d2311933", "PEPE"),
        ("0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE", "SHIB"),
        ("0x761D38e5ddf6ccf6Cf7c55759d5210750B5D60F3", "ELON"),
        // Add more memecoins with addresses
    ].iter().cloned().collect()
}

// Track memecoin trading volume and frequency
async fn analyze_memecoin_activity(transfers: &[TokenTransfer]) -> MemeMetrics {
    // Count transfers involving known memecoins
    // Calculate volume in USD equivalent
    // Track unique memecoins traded
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Wallets:
1. **Heavy Casino User**: Address with RLB, SHFL holdings + contract interactions
2. **DeFi Power User**: Address with Aave, Compound, GMX usage
3. **Bridge User**: Address with multiple cross-chain transactions
4. **Memecoin Trader**: Address with high PEPE, SHIB trading volume

### Validation Metrics:
- Casino platforms detected should match known usage
- DeFi protocol count should include all major platforms
- Historical interactions should be captured even without current holdings
- Score should reflect true "degen" behavior patterns
