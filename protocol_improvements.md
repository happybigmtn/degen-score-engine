# Protocol Detection Improvements Plan

Based on comprehensive on-chain research and protocol analysis, this document outlines critical improvements to the Degen Score Engine's protocol detection capabilities.

## Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)

### 1. Hyperliquid USDC Token Address
**Issue**: Using bridged USDC (USDC.e) instead of native USDC
- Current: `0xFF970A61A04b1cA14834A43f5dE4533eBDDB5CC8` (USDC.e)
- Correct: `0xaf88d065ef77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831` (Native USDC on Arbitrum)
- **Impact**: Missing all Hyperliquid deposits using native USDC

### 2. Perpetual Protocol ClearingHouse Address
**Issue**: Potential typo in address
- Current: `0x82ac2CE43e33583Cd50c42a43B7b4a525F0459Bc`
- Verify: `0x82ac2CE43e33683c58Be4cDC40975e73AA50f459` (from Optimistic Etherscan)
- **Impact**: Missing all Perpetual Protocol activity

### 3. CHIPS Token Address (WINR/JustBet)
**Issue**: Missing CHIPS token detection

    transfers_out: u32,
    total_amount: Decimal,
    min_amount_usd: Decimal,
) -> bool {
    // Require either:
    // - Multiple transfers (not just airdrop)
    // - Significant amount
    // - Both directions (received AND sent)
    (transfers_in + transfers_out > 2) ||
    (total_amount > min_amount_usd) ||
    (transfers_in > 0 && transfers_out > 0)
}
```

    explorer_api: &str,
    contract_address: &str,
    user_address: &str,
    from_block: u64,
) -> Result<Vec<Log>> {
    // Implementation for explorer API calls
}
```

### 2. Caching Layer
